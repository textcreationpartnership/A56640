            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOURS PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Need not tell the well diſpoſed Reader, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much ſaid and writ continually in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how natural and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is for all rational creatures, to look back upon all occaſions to the Author of their being; that they may make him their hearty acknowledgements for all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they have received from him, and ſtill recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all their concerns, to
<pb facs="tcp:43650:4"/>
his continued Grace and good Providence. Nor ſhall I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſhow how much the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God in his own houſe is to be preferred before the private Devotion of Families at home: there being no reaſon, as far as I understand, to make the latter neceſſary, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in most places, Chriſtian people cannot meet together, at the Church, every day Morning and Evening, to give to God the glory that is due unto his Name.</p>
            <p>My buſineſs is to deſire him to remember, how natural it is likewiſe to all mankind to take ſuch good advice before-hand,
<pb facs="tcp:43650:4"/>
when they have any petitions or thanks to prefer unto earthly gods, as that they may be delivered in a decent and grave form of words, as well as after a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend manner: and to conſider therefore, with what ſober and prudent care all thoſe expreſſions ought to be weighed, wherein they preſent the humble deſires and grateful affections of their hearts, to the moſt High God, the eternal Majesty of heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>It hath not proved I am ſure an honour to Religion, that men have learnt to be leſs ſolicitous about the one, than they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the other. But ſuch have
<pb facs="tcp:43650:5"/>
been the licentious rambles of their fancy in ſuddain Prayer, ſo bold and rude have their deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions been of Almighty God, ſo raſh their affirmations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him or concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo many untrue or doubtful things have they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that it is ſufficient, in my poor judgement, to blaſt the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that way of addreſs to him, as it hath done, alas! with too many, the credit of Chriſtian Piety, which hath ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly by ſuch extravagance.</p>
            <p>I know there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that will be ready to oppoſe me in this particular, with whom I liſt not to diſpute in this ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:43650:5"/>
Preface. Let me only beſeech them to uſe ſo much moderation, as not to diſcourage honest-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people from performing their duty to God, by diſgracing any longer, as they have been wont to do, all Book-prayers. Which if they have not the advantage (as I think they have) of ſuddain conceptions and expreſſions, yet are ſo neceſſary in the Church, that without them many perſons cannot pray at all. And I hope they will confeſs, upon due deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, that though ſome few may have attained an habit of uttering their deſires freely, and becomingly upon any occaſion, yet as the uſe of it before others is too apt to miniſter to pride, vain-glory,
<pb facs="tcp:43650:6"/>
and ſelf-conceit; ſo moſt people are ſo defective both in their conceptions and utterance, as not to be able to diſcharge this holy duty as they ought, without ſuch aſſiſtance as is here offered them.</p>
            <p>How well I have performed what I have undertaken, I must leave to the judgement of others. I am ſure I have proceeded with deliberation; and ſtudied faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to avoid all affected ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, fantaſtical alluſions, inſignificant allegories, pretended wit, and elegant converſions of ſentences, and raſh application of the holy Scripture to my preſent purpoſe: which have been the
<pb facs="tcp:43650:6"/>
vices, perhaps, of ſome forms, though not ſo frequently, as well as of mens haſty inventions.</p>
            <p>I have laboured alſo to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Reader with ſome varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not becauſe I think it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beſt to uſe it, but becauſe ſome weak and ſqueamiſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites will not be ſatisfied without it. And beſides Prayers for Families, I have compoſed a great many other for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons; wherein if I have failed in the clearneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of my expreſſions, it was much againſt my will: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admoniſhed of it by my friends, I will reform it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe that is amiſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43650:7"/>
But the length, or the brevity of the Prayers ſure will not be accuſed, becauſe there are of both ſorts; that they who like not the one, may make uſe of the other.</p>
            <p>Some, I doubt not, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that they find not a Prayer for ſome particular want of theirs, not here named; but that's a defect which could not be remedied. For I knew not where to ſtop, if I had extended my thoughts beyond thoſe neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are moſt common; and the reſt, I hope, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably well ſupplied out of that which I have done to ſerve the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43650:7"/>
It is poſſible alſo that ſome may judge this whole Work to be but a needleſs labour: ſince they have the Book of <hi>Common Prayers</hi> at hand, which they can uſe at home, as well as in the Church. With theſe perſons I ſhall not contend; but only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my opinion freely about this matter. Which is, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to that Book will be beſt preſerved, by employing it only in the publick Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; or in the private, where there is a Prieſt to officiate. However, the deſign of it is not to furniſh the people with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for all thoſe particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, wherein devout ſouls would make their requeſts to God.
<pb facs="tcp:43650:8"/>
And the conſtant opinion of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divines, in this and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, we ſee, by their writings, hath been; that other Books of Prayers, which they have compoſed, are neceſſary for the Flock of Chriſt, beſides their publick Liturgie.</p>
            <p>That which remains, is only to intreat thoſe who will make uſe of this Book which is here tendered to them; Firſt, to ſtirr up their hearts to offer their Praiſes, Thanksgivings, and Prayers unto God our heavenly Father, with fervent devotion of ſpirit. And then, not to imagine the reading them out of a Book is any hindrance to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
<pb facs="tcp:43650:8"/>
but rather a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble help, and much better than truſting the memory even with a form. For a mans mind hath nothing to do, when he hath the words before his eyes; but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to intend it ſelf, to the raiſing of its affections unto the greatest height and ardency of deſire, and love, and joy, that it is able.</p>
            <p>But take heed, I beſeech you, in the last place; leſt the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe holy duties, with ſome affection, deceive you into the neglect of all the reſt. Our Prayers will be fruitleſs, if they be not attended with our ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtudy and earneſt labour, to attain that which we beſeech God
<pb facs="tcp:43650:9"/>
to beſtow upon us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a ſincere hatred of all ſin, and a ſpirit armed with hearty reſolution againſt it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Divine Grace for your aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>If you be true Chriſtian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that <hi>manfully fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the banner of our Lord,</hi> call to him for aid, with your weapons in your hand. With a mind bent to conſider, deſire God to enlighten you. And with an heart ſtored with the treaſures of Divine Truth, beſeech him to quicken and enliven you. And with cloſe and urgent applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them to your heart, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to enable you to form
<pb facs="tcp:43650:9"/>
and ſhape your whole man, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſoul and body, according to them. For God is not hard to be entreated, ſince he entreats us to come to him, yea gives a great deal of his grace without asking: but it is the faintneſs or inconſtancy of our endeavours to comply with his grace, and our own petitions, that makes them no more prevalent.</p>
            <p>They that had no other Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, but the light of their own minds, ſaw this well enough, and were ſo ſenſible of this truth; that they were wont publickly to declaim (as we find in <hi>Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> his Oration to the <hi>Rhodians</hi> concerning Concord) againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:43650:10"/>
               <hi>abſurd folly of thoſe, who were perpetually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning the Gods with their Prayers, but would do nothing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi>

            <p>As for thoſe who do not live well, it is plain, ſaith he in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. Strom.</note> that they do not ſo much as know what
<pb facs="tcp:43650:11"/>
things are moſt profitable for themſelves. And if ſo, then it is manifeſt likewiſe that they cannot tell how to pray to God to receive good things from him, being ignorant of what is good. Or if they ſhould receive them, they would have no ſenſe at all of the gift, nor uſe it according to its worth and dignity; and that for the very ſame reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they understand not its value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſpire therefore, O God of all Grace, I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech thee, both my heart and the hearts of all others who ſhall read this Book, with ſuch a godly

                     <p>For which end we moſt humbly implore the aſſiſtance of thy good ſpirit, which our Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged us to hope thou wilt give to thoſe, that ask and ſeek it with their whole heart.

We have often ſpoken great things of thee; and declared thy ſervice to be the ſweeteſt pleaſure, and one hour ſpent in holy meditations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout affections, and cheerful thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, to be far better than all the time we ſpend in other imployments.

We are aſhamed that any wearineſs ſhould ſeize on our ſpirits; and that it ſhould be irkſome to us, to renew our thoughts and acknowledgements of thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs. Behold, O Lord, we are reſolved again to addreſs our ſelves unto thee with praiſe and thankſgiving, for giving us ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to look back to thee, the Author of our being; to lift up our ſouls towards our heavenly

                     <p>We admire thy glory, O great Lord of heaven and earth, which ſhines in the whole Creation; thy greater glory in the work of our redemption, by the miraculous Birth, Life, Death, and Reſurrection of Chriſt Jeſus; and the greateſt of all, which we hope and wait for at his appearing, when he <hi>ſhall come to be admired in his Saints, and glorified in all them that believe.</hi> Thou haſt

And yet, ſuch is thy goodneſs, thou condeſcendeſt to admit, nay, to draw us to a fellowſhip with thoſe holy ſpirits; that we may thereby be made happy, and called thy ſervants, though, when we have done the beſt we can, very unprofitable.</p>

                     <p>By thee we were formed and brought out of our Mothers Womb. And by a greater mercy were early born again, and made thy children in Chriſt Jeſus.

                     <p>O Moſt great and mighty Lord; the Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth. All the Angels worſhip and adore thy incomprehenſible Majeſty with the humbleſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and rejoyce in rendring praiſe, bleſſing, and thankſgiving to thee, the Father of ſpirits: For thou haſt created all things, and in wiſdom haſt thou made them all, and ſpread thy tender mercies over all thy works. It is no leſs our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than our duty to joyn our

hearts and voices with that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoſt, moſt gratefully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy bounty to us among the reſt of thy creatures, and thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace and favour in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our moſt merciful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer. We can never ſufficiently admire that love which gave him to dye for us, and hath made him the Lord of life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that he may be the Author of eternal Salvation to all thoſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him. All the love we have is too little to give thee, to whom all our ſervices are due by a former ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Our higheſt praiſes fall infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of thy moſt excellent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; and we are aſhamed of the moſt affectionate thanks we can render to thee for thoſe ineſtimable benefits which thou haſt conferred on us, and ſo long continued to us.</p>
                     <p>How much greater reaſon then have we to be abaſhed at our ſhameful ingratitude and diſobedience to thy divine Majeſty; for which we are

heartily ſorry, and do now moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly repent our ſelves of it: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly reſolving, and proteſting to be more faithful to thee for the time to come. Pardon us therefore, Good Lord, and receive us unto thy mercy. Accept of our renewed vows to ſtudy and do our duties conſcientiouſly, towards thee, and towards all men. And as thou haſt excited theſe holy deſires and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in our hearts, ſo inable us to perform them conſtantly in the whole courſe of our life.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Saviour hath told us, thou wilt as readily give thy holy Spirit to them that ask it, as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent will give bread to his hungry children. O Father of mercies, let it be unto us according to his Word. Cheriſh theſe little beginnings of goodneſs which thou ſeeſt in our ſouls; and proſper all our endeavours to attain a greater meaſure of it. And ſince at the beſt we are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, and can do no

more than was our duty to do: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to do every thing, which thou haſt commanded us, heartily, with good will, and true love to thy ſervice. We know this is all that can, in the leaſt, commend us to thy free grace and favour: and therefore we moſt humbly again dovote our ſelves to do thy Will, with a cordial affection to it. We would ever approach unto thee with delight and pleaſure: and feel it the joy of our hearts to think of thee, to praiſe thee, to give thee thanks, and to offer our ſelves with abſolute reſignation to thee. O that Mercy may always pleaſe us as it pleaſeth thee! that we may be ſtrictly juſt and righteous; may chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully paſs by injuries; freely deny all deſires of ſinful pleaſures; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit to thy fatherly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and perform the duties of our ſeveral relations, with ſingleneſs of heart.

And O that all thoſe who are forgetful of their duty to thee, may be awakened to a lively ſenſe of all thy benefits,

and fill the whole world with thy praiſes. Stir up eſpecially the minds of all Chriſtian people, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after and follow the Truth, as it is in Jeſus: abandoning all vice and wickedneſs, and exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have conſciences void of offence, towards thee, and towards all men. And diſpoſe the hearts of all their Kings and Princes, to make themſelves the greateſt examples of Chriſtian Piety to all others. Bleſs theſe Kingdoms, and indue our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign with ſuch excellent Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and holy Zeal for thy honour and glory; that we may ſee many good days under his Government.

what we have received thence: and is owing intirely to thy free and bounteous love, O moſt bleſſed Creator; and to the unſearchable riches of thy grace, O moſt bleſſed Redeemer. To thee therefore be given by us and all creatures, whom thou haſt made to know how great and how good thou art, all honour, glory and praiſe; all love, ſervice and obedience, as long as we have any being. It is but meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we ſhould at all times, and in all places give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and devoutly reſign both ſoul and body to thee, to be abſolutely governed and ruled according to thy holy will and pleaſure. We are heartily ſorry that we have not done it, from the very beginning of our lives till this time. We are aſhamed to think of our injuſtice and ingratitude, in following our own deſires ſo long, and rendring our ſelves, no ſooner, moſt humbly obedient in all things

                     <p>And we hope in them not only for a pardon, which we earneſtly implore according to thy gracious promiſes made in Chriſt Jeſus, but for the power of thy holy Spirit, to further and promote thoſe godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, which we feel already in our hearts, to live as becomes thy creatures; and as becomes the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt, who were ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedicated to thee, and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſince vowed themſelves to thy ſervice.

That Kings may be tender-hearted, as the Fathers of their Countries; and all their ſubjects may be dutiful and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to them as their children: That the Paſtors of the Church may feed thy flock with Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and the people may all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them, and follow their godly counſels: That the rich and mighty may have compaſſion on the poor and miſerable; and all ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed people may bleſs the rich, and rejoyce in the proſperity of thoſe that are above them.

                  <p>O Moſt holy, bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty of heaven and earth.

O thou who haſt ſent thy Son from heaven to dwell among us, who haſt not ſpared his life, but given him up for us all, who haſt raiſed him from the dead, and made him heir of all things, who haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him all power in heaven and earth, that he may bleſs us and do us good; deny not the deſires of a ſoul, that offers up it ſelf intirely in ſincere affection to thy ſervice.

                  <p>O Lord, the Creator of the world, and the Redeemer of mankind. Who knoweſt all things; and canſt do what thou pleaſeſt; and wilt do that which is beſt for thy children; and haſt done us a world of good already; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do more for us, if we be obedient, than we can ask or think; and haſt given us the greateſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of thoſe promiſes by thy Son Jeſus; who dyed for us, and whom thou haſt raiſed from the dead, and given him the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, which he hath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth abundantly, to ſhed abroad thy love in our hearts. I fall down before thee in the lowlieſt manner, to expreſs my fear and reverence of thy Almighty Power; my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of and ſubmiſſion to thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable wiſdom; my hearty love, and thankful acknowledgement of

                  <p>There is nothing, O Lord, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive to me, as the remembrance that I have any time offended thy Soveraign Authority. I am hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorry for the breaking of any of thy ſacred, righteous and good Laws. I abhorr the thoughts of doing ſo again. And proteſt eternal enmity to all that is contrary to thy bleſſed Will: addicting my ſelf with moſt hearty affection to thy true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice. Pardon me therefore, moſt gracious and merciful Father, and accept theſe holy reſolutions which thou haſt inſpired me withal. Strengthen, I beſeech thee, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them with thy continued grace, that no ſudden deſires, vehement incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ineffectual purpoſes, no nor partial performances, may deceive and lead me into a falſe opinion of

Poſſeſs me with ſuch a deep and ſtrong ſenſe of thy ſupreme Authority over all, of the obligations I have to thee, and the great kindneſs thou haſt done me in ingaging me to be thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; that Religion may be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs of my life, and my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure may be to pleaſe thee in every thing, and my higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to attain that bleſſed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which Chriſt Jeſus hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>

Remember me but of my duty; quicken and excite me to it; ſtrengthen me in the doing of it; ſupport me under all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; adviſe me in all difficult caſes; and comfort me with a ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt belief of thy holy Word; and I ſhall ever be giving thanks and praiſe

And how ſhall I come, O Lord, but in the loweſt proſtrations of my ſoul and body; with mine eyes full of tears, and my heart full of grief and ſorrow, becauſe I have been ſo undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to thee, whoſe grace and mercy hath ſo exceedingly abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us!

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43650:113"/>
I am aſtoniſhed at the wonderful greatneſs of thy love, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the thoughts of men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>For what were we that thou ſhouldeſt make thy dear Son a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, for our ſake? That he ſhould become poor and mean, not having where to lay his head; and indure likewiſe cruel mockings and buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and be ſpit upon and abuſed; yea, ſorely wounded and bruiſed; and drink that bitter cup, the vile and accurſed death of the croſs; where he ſhed his moſt precious bloud, and gave himſelf a ranſome for us? O Lord, what was the whole race of mankind worth, that thou ſhouldeſt purchaſe them with ſo dear a price? and by the obedience of thy Son Chriſt Jeſus unto the death, grant a pardon for their rebellion? and ſeal a new Covenant of Grace in his bloud? and by the ſame bloud conſecrate him to be an high-Prieſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43650:113"/>
with royal Power in the heavens, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſin? and all this, ſo freely, that we did not ſo much as deſire it, nor did it enter into the heart of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them? O bleſſed God, how rich is thy goodneſs, that lets us withal injoy a great plenty of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good things; much of that eaſe and pleaſure which was denyed our dear Saviour? and yet we are ſinners, and he had no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: yea, we are ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſinners, ſo far from being ſenſible as we ought of ſuch infinite loving kindneſs; that we may juſtly fear leſt this goodneſs of thine which was deſigned to ſave us, ſhould through our unthankfulneſs and negligence, prove the occaſion of our greater ruine.</p>
                  <p>I moſt heartily bewail, O moſt merciful Father, my ſhameful forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſo great benefits, or my cold and dull remembrance of them.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43650:114"/>
I lament all the errors and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of my life, which are the more heynous, I acknowledge, after ſuch a plain declaration of thy diſpleaſure againſt ſin, and of thy marvellous love to us ſinners. I am afflicted for the hardneſs and ſtupidity of my heart, which, alas! is oft-times little pierced and wounded, when I reflect upon his ſorrow and pain, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for the ſake of ſinners: and for the liſtleſſneſs and backwardneſs of my will to give up my ſelf abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, who ſo willingly gave himſelf an offering for our ſins. I bluſh to remember how weak and ſhort my thoughts have been; how tranſient and ineffectual my paſſions, when I have meditated on his bloudy death and ſufferings: And am confounded when I think how ſuddenly I have ſtarted from thoſe holy purpoſes and reſolutions, which the ſenſe of his love hath ſometimes begot in my heart.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but accuſe and condemn
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43650:114"/>
my ſelf here in thy preſence; but I likewiſe condemn every ſinful deſire that is ſtill remaining in me, to dye and be crucified together with him. I would have nothing contrary to thy Will, to have any power, or live any longer in me: and therefore here yield up my ſelf intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hands, to be conformed in all things to Chriſt Jeſus who dyed for me. Fix my thoughts ſo conſtantly upon his dying love, and affect my heart ſo mightily therewith, that I may chearfully undergo any pains to be made like unto him in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; in his obedience; in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of himſelf to thy wiſe will and pleaſure; in his patience; in his meekneſs, in his charity, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his enemies; in his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to quit all things for thy names ſake, and to truſt both ſoul and body with thee, in well doing and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuffering, whatſoever it be that thou requireſt of me.</p>
                  <p>I deſire not to live, O Lord, but
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43650:115"/>
that I may live to him that dyed for me. I refuſe no reproaches, no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, no pain or trouble, if thy will cannot other ways be accompliſhed by me. Do what thou pleaſeſt with me, ſo that I may but be perfected in holineſs, and obtain thy gracious pardon through the redemption that is in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>I believe the vertue and power of his Sacrifice to be everlaſting; and that <hi>when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I look for the conſtant aſſiſtance of thy good Spirit, which he hath bid me ask in his Name, to inable me to purifie my ſelf, and to tread in the ſteps of his humble, meek and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Charity; that ſo I may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unblameable and unprovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thy ſight at the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.

O that the comfort and joy of this hope, to ſee Jeſus who was ſo ſcorned and abuſed, ſitting upon his throne, and triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his enemies, may ſo raiſe and inlarge my mind by the power of it, that I may overlook and deſpiſe all the petty temptations of this world: looking ſtill ſteadfaſtly unto him, and following him with unmoveable reſolution; till I come to poſſeſs that which I hope for, and rejoyce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in his love.</p>

                  <p>Accordingly I am now proſtrate before thee, to implore the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued powerful preſence of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace, to which I owe theſe holy thoughts that are in my mind, and by which alone I can hope to perform and accompliſh them. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs me, O God, with ſuch a full and lively ſenſe of thy undeſerved and unwearied love and kindneſs to me, in paſſing by ſo much ingratitude, and ſo many tranſgreſſions; in laying on me ſuch ſtrong and manifold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to be happy by obeying thee, and in affording me ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſiſtances to attain that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that I may love thee proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably with a more conſtant and ſteadfaſt affection, and feel an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable

will ſettled in me, to do the duty thou requireſt of me; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whatſoever ſtate and condition of life, thou ſhalt be pleaſed to diſpoſe me.</p>
                  <p>When we have loved thee all that we can, I am ſenſible we have loved thee but a little; becauſe we, and all that we can do are ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. How ſmall a thing then is it, how poor and contemptible, that we return unto thee; when we love thee not ſo much as we are able! O bleſſed God, cauſe ſuch a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of thy goodneſs to fall upon my heart, and to abide with me, that all the powers of my ſoul may ſtrain themſelves to love thee, and unite themſelves unto thee, in an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble choice of thy Will, to be the ſole governour of all my deſigns, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and actions throughout the whole courſe of my life.

To thee therefore, with the deliberate and full conſent of my will, I devote my ſelf; reſolving to love and ſerve thee, with all my heart, and with all my ſoul, and with all my ſtrength.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43650:129"/>
of thy Son Chriſt; how early I was dedicated to thy ſervice; how often I have ſince found abundant cauſe to determine I would be thine; how I have condemned my ſelf for the breach of thoſe holy purpoſes, and what great ſatisfaction of mind I have had in the keeping of thy Commandments: That ſo I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wilfully offend againſt ſo many forcible reaſons obliging me to my duty; but be ſwayed by them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the temptations of the world, the fleſh or the devil, to perſevere in a reſolved obedience to thee for ever.

For which end, help me often to place my ſelf before thy Judgement Seat, and to conſider that I muſt give an account for all that I have

                  <p>O Moſt great and glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of heaven and earth: who art of unſpotted purity, and in whom there is not the leaſt ſhadow of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43650:130"/>
change. I know that all the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of thy Wiſdom are moſt juſt and equal; and I cannot chuſe, when I am in my right mind, to be guided by any thing elſe, but thy holy Will: who deſigneſt, I ſee, in all the revelations thou haſt made of thy ſelf to us, to make us like to thy own, moſt bleſſed, Nature. I do here own and acknowledge moſt heartily the righteouſneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all thy Laws; I admire the lovelineſs of thy Image, in wiſdom, righteouſneſs and true holineſs; I loath my own deformity whilſt I am unlike to thee; I implore thy renewing grace as the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing I can receive from thee; and I bind my ſelf to the faithful improvement of it, as the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt imployment of my life.</p>
                  <p>I am abundantly ſatisfied in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration thou haſt made of thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purpoſes towards us. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all thoughts and deſires that are contrary thereunto; and reſolve
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43650:131"/>
that holineſs and eternal life ſhall be my deſign and ſtudy. I expect no pardon, O my God, but in ways of ſobriety, righteouſneſs and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. I hope for a bleſſed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, only by patient continuance in well doing. I conſent to every part of thy holy Goſpel: and add my teſtimony to the truth of its words, that <hi>none of thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are grievous; but thy yoke is eaſie, and thy burden light.</hi> I hope, O Lord, by thy grace I ſhall never contradict my ſelf, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning in my practice, theſe free and ſerious profeſſions: But that I ſhall every day ſo call to mind my own proteſtations and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to continue with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence in ſtedfaſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to thy commands, and to grow ſtill ſtronger in the grace of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>O that every ſuch addreſs as this unto thy Divine Majeſty, may leave a greater ſenſe of thee, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43650:131"/>
of my duty, and of my happineſs, and of my manifold obligations, and repeated promiſes, upon my heart. That I may always go out of thy preſence with my mind more towards heaven; with low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thoughts of all the injoyments of this life; with a greater reliſh of piety and holineſs; and more paſſionate deſires to become every way ſuch as thou canſt approve, and love and delight in for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

O God of all grace and might, the root of our life, and power and ſtrength; without whom all good deſires and purpoſes wither and die:

withdraw not the ſweet influences of thy holy Spirit from thy unworthy ſervant, who intirely confides in thee, and hath no hope but in thy infinite Mercies.

                  <p>I am ſenſible, O Lord, that we live in a world of temptations, and that our nature is weak, and ready to yield to them; and that our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are apt to wander after vanity, and that ſudden paſſions oftentimes tranſport us from our duty.

                  <p>When we conſider all this, we may juſtly wonder at our ſelves, that we ſhould not fear thee, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thee, and love thee, and ſeek thy love and favour above all things; by ſtudying to pleaſe thee in univerſal obedience to thy bleſſed will; which deſigns to imploy thy Almighty Power to make us ſo great, ſo happy, and ſo glorious.

Thou ſendeſt one bleſſing, as the earneſt of another: having given thy Son to us, that he might give us thy holy Spirit; and given him to dye for us, that he might give us life. Thou granteſt to us thy grace, that we may repent: and thou giveſt repentance, that thou mayſt give us pardon: and thou pardoneſt our ſins, that we may be thy children; and being thy

Thou giveſt us tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings, that we may thirſt after ſpiritual: and thou filleſt us with ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, that we may long for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them in immortal life. There is none can declare the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord. We beſt declare our ſenſe of it, when we thankfully receive it; and become as good as thou wouldſt have us, and inableſt us to be. And how great, how free is that goodneſs, which is moſt of all pleaſed when we are happy! and eſteems our doing our ſelves good, with thy grace and favour, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that we ſhould make to thy bounty! Thou doſt us good before we ask; and thou giveſt liberally unto us, that thou mayſt move us to ask more. Thou intreateſt us when we are unwilling: thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheſt us, that we would let thee bleſs us, and not put impediments
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:43650:254"/>
in the way of our own happineſs: thou pittieſt us, when we have no compaſſion for our ſelves; and art ſtill careful of us, when we trifle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the richeſt mercies.</p>
